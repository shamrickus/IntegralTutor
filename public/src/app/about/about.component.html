    <p>We’ll start from the beginning!</p>
    <p>I’ve always had a pretty healthy relationship with math. I never really struggled in it and it certainly was never a topic that I dreaded in school. It was right around middle school that a few qualities really flourished. In seventh grade, I had a math teacher who was just brimming with vigor. He taught my class all the important techniques of algebra but he had a lot of fun with it. What I remember most is him threatening to flog us with geometric shapes if we didn’t behave. “What will it be today? A triangle? Or perhaps an octagon?” It really left an impression on me, because I started to make lame math jokes right around this time because of that teacher. I was already pretty dramatic overall, so I just paired acting cool and mathematics together for comedic effect. I had also decided that maybe I’d wanted to be a math teacher somewhere in the 7th or 8th grade. I held onto that desire for a long time, strayed for a few years, but as you may notice I’m right back on that track.</p>
    <p>I had a series of impressionable teachers after that. I had a few more hip and young teachers, and a lot more that were elderly and stuck to the basics. They inspired me with passion and then they inspired me with their discipline. The combination of passion and discipline made me a respected authority on the topic amongst my peers. Now, let me tell you: I was a lazy kid. If I didn’t want to do something, there was almost no chance of coaxing me into it. However, if somebody came to me with a math question, I leapt on the opportunity. I loved explaining math to people and I had a talent for it.</p>
    <p>It wasn’t until halfway through college that I actually became a tutor. A professor had name dropped me as a good candidate for the math center on campus. It never dawned on me that I could work there even as a student, so I accepted immediately and went it for an interview. It wasn’t until the interview was over that they told me that I was going to be paid for this. I was so excited I didn’t think for a second that I could be PAID to tutor? Granted, it was at a greatly discounted rate, but I had gone in there under the impression that I was doing charity work. What a time to be alive. So I worked there, honing my talents for two years until I graduated, and then I worked with some other companies as a contractor for a year (the most recent year, actually) where I was somewhat independent as a tutoring entity.</p>
    <p>This period is where I developed what I’m using as the platform for The Integral Tutor. I teach the essentials. Ask yourself: what are the essential skills for a good pianist? Maybe they know a lot of songs. Maybe they can sight-read sheet music. Maybe they have a natural talent for it. I think what makes a good pianist is a rigorous respect for the basics of music. They practice regularly, visit the scales often, and are honest with their weaknesses. In a similar manner, this is the revelation I had with mathematics.</p>
    <p>There are a certain few strategies I’ve been using since maybe the 7th grade in every aspect of algebra up to assorted calculus topics. I’d always investigate misunderstandings and study skills in my students, and I found that study skills were SEVERELY lacking. These auxiliary skills are what I credit almost every bit of my “affinity” for mathematics towards and it seemed almost all of my students were totally lacking in them. We’ve all been told to check our work in math, and everybody confidently says they know how to check their work, but I don’t think that’s the case. As an example, somebody will just look over what they’ve done to see if they’re correct. Looking over what you’ve done is extremely ineffective because <b>there isn’t any real feedback.</b> You might look over your engine in your car and say everything’s good, but then when you try to start it, it erupts into flames. That is feedback and now you are well aware something is wrong. That ability to provide yourself with feedback is something truly incredible.</p>
    <p>That brings us to The Integral Tutor. I think a lot of current techniques to improve student performance are nickle and diming students. A new edition of a textbook every year might improve scores 0.2% for any individual, but I believe what I have to offer is what will make leaps and bounds in a student’s performance. Teaching a student how to fend for themselves in their education will provide them with valuable lifelong lessons to apply across numerous disciplines. Every day, our students receive lessons on content and rarely if ever on study skills. Somewhere in the grand scheme of things, the second half of that education was lost. I’m here to bring it back.</p>
